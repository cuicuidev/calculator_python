## Calculator

I know, sounds like a trivial task, which I could've done like this:

```python
eval(input("Enter your mathematical expression:\n"))
```

_But where's the **fun** in that?_

Instead, I've built a string parser that tokenizes the input, builds an abstract syntaxt tree and computes the result recursively using depth first search!
